⚠ Warning
=========

git-darcs needs a repository only for tracking. Don't use your working
git-repository. git-darcs will clear all your work that is not commited. It also
needs to temporarily change `.gitignore` and `_darcs/pref/boring`. By default it
will warn about this. You can add `-nw` to avoid the warning. The tutorial never
contains a `-nw`, so people don't copy-paste from the tutorial and lose their
work.

The tool is made for developers, while error-handling is okayish, there is
almost no error-reporting, you'll have to read the traceback.

Install
=======

Integration tests run on python 3.7 - 3.11.

```sh-session
$ pip install git-darcs
```

Use-cases
=========

Main use-case
-------------

Use the excellent capabilities of darcs to craft consistent, clear and concise
patches while the remote repository still remains git. Thats the situation most
of us in are because at work we have to use git.

Other use-cases
---------------

* Convert a git repository to darcs using the [linearized history](#linearized-history)
  proposed by git-darcs
* Visualize a git-repository using `darcs show dependencies`

But why?
--------

I prefer to group changes by topic, so I am constantly amending commits/patches.
This is very easy in darcs and more complicated in git. Yes, I know about
`--fixup` and `--autosquash` in git. Also I can find independent low-risk
patches easily with `darcs show dependencies`, so I can constantly make MRs.
Making the final _breaking_ change/MR much smaller. This is less tedious for the
reviewers.

Tutorial
========

The tutorial covers the main use-case:

1. Check-out a git-repo, because at work you have to use git
2. Snapshot the latest commit into darcs
3. Craft patches: Use the excellent capabilities of darcs to move code between
   patches to create very consistent and clean patches
4. Use `git darcs pull` to bring the darcs-patches back into git and
   create pull-request

Clone your tracking-repository.

```sh-session
$ git clone https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/document-merge-service.git dms-track
Cloning into 'document-merge-service'...

.....

Resolving deltas: 100% (1267/1267), done.
```

Lazily import the git-repository to darcs.

```sh-session
$ git darcs update
Use CTRL-D for a graceful shutdown.
```

git-darcs will import the latest commit and tag it, so it can update from there,
when you pull commits from upstream.

```sh-session
$ (cd dms-track; darcs log)
patch 7997a3365da1022db4b669ea63a37dc3f370a225

```

Create the work-repository. Note that git and darcs make sure that no historical
data is duplicated on disk (using hardlinks).

```sh-session
$ git darcs clone dms-track/ dms-work
clone: 100%|████████████████████████████████████████████████| 5/5 [00:00<00:00, 37.75it/s]
```

Now you can implement a new feature.

```sh-session
$ cd dms-work
$ touch document_merge_service/feature.py
$ darcs add document_merge_service/feature.py
Adding './document_merge_service/feature.py'
Finished adding:
./document_merge_service/feature.py

$ darcs record -m "a new feature"
addfile ./document_merge_service/feature.py
Shall I record this change? (1/1)  [ynW...], or ? for more options: y
Do you want to Record these changes? [Yglqk...], or ? for more options: y
Finished recording patch 'a new feature'
```

```sh-session
$ darcs show dependencies | dot -Tpdf -Grankdir=TB -o $ftmp
```

![first record](https://github.com/ganwell/git-darcs/blob/main/_static/first.png?raw=true)

There are new changes on upstream, let's pull them in.

```sh-session
$ cd ../dms-track/
$ git pull
Updating d3ce714..a6a8e35
Fast-forward
 .github/workflows/tests.yml                         |  6 ++++-
 
.....
 
 18 files changed, 262 insertions(+), 67 deletions(-)
```

From now on git-darcs will import every commit, but with a linearized
history. That means the history might look different than in git, but no change will be
forgotten. (See [Linearized History](#linearized-history))

```sh-session
$ git darcs update
Use CTRL-D for a graceful shutdown.
commits:
100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 18/18 [00:00<00:00, 19.14it/s]
```

We pull the new patches into `dms-work`.

```sh-session
$ cd ../dms-track/
$ darcs pull ../dms-track/
Pulling from "/home/jeanlf/Temp/dms-track"...

```

The 18 patches we pulled are now in `dms-work` along with a new snapshot-tag.

```sh-session
$ darcs log --from-tag=.

  * a new feature
```

We can now either pull the `a new feature`-patch into `dms-track` or we can
create a temporary `dms-stage` so it is easier to clean up after the
merge-request has been accepted. Note `git-darcs clone` will copy git-remotes
from the source, so you can push into your fork if it is set up.

If you pull into `dms-track` instead, you have to remove patches or commits on
both darcs and git, keeping darcs and git manually in sync.


```sh-session
$ cd ..
$ git darcs clone dms-track/ dms-stage
clone: 100%|████████████████████████████████████████████████| 5/5 [00:00<00:00, 48.32it/s]
$ cd dms-stage
```

`git-darcs pull` tries to emulate `darcs pull`.

```sh-session
$ git darcs pull ../dms-work/

For darcs beginners
===================

* There is a great [video](https://hikari.acmelabs.space/videos/hikari-darcs.mp4) by
  [raichoo](https://hub.darcs.net/raichoo) the maintainer of
  [hikari](https://hikari.acmelabs.space/)
* You have to read the [darcs book](https://darcsbook.acmelabs.space/), you just
  have to
* `_darcs/pref/boring` is the equivalent of `.gitignore`, but has quite a wide
  definition of boring by default

Caveats
=======

Performance
-----------

git-darcs will playback the history of the git-repository. Every commit that is
recorded will first be checked out in git and then recorded in darcs. For that reason
git-darcs lazily imports the latest commit by default. This is how it is meant
to be used: Using darcs to complement git. You can use it to convert
repositories, if you like the way non-linear history is handled, it will be
sloooow. See also `darcs convert import`.

chmod and symbolic links
------------------------

Darcs does not handle `chmod` or symbolic links. The easiest way to work around
this is by  letting `git` do the work. Since I always make git-commits from the
darcs-patches `git` will track `chmod` and symbolic links for me.

Linearized History
------------------

git-darcs will traverse the git-history in topological order. For every commit
it encounters, it will test if the previous commit was an ancestor, if not it
will ignore that commit for now. That way git-darcs can only "enter" one branch
of parallel history. Once it reaches a commit that is an ancestor it will import
that commit and log the complete history between it and the last successful
commit. So git-darcs creates patches that combine the complete history of a
parallel branch.

This git-log

```sh-session
$ git log --oneline --graph
* eef24d8 (HEAD -> master) end > end0
* 841c900 end
*   969ad57 Merge branch 'b'
|\
| * 76ca538 (b) bb2 > bb3

* 665937d aa > aa0, bb bb0

```

becomes this darcs-log

```sh-session
* eef24d8 end > end0
    move ./end ./end0
* 841c900 end
    addfile ./end
* 969ad57 Merge branch 'b'
  76ca538 bb2 > bb3
  0040cee bb1 > bb2
    move ./bb1 ./bb3
* 663168a antiforward > antiforward0
    move ./antiforward ./antiforward0
* 0d94733 Merge branch 'a'
  d26d325 aa2 > aa3
  8090696 aa1 > aa2
    move ./aa1 ./aa3
* fa7accb antiforward
    addfile ./antiforward
* 7bc2b76 aa0 > aa1, bb0 > bb1
    move ./aa0 ./aa1
    move ./bb0 ./bb1
* 665937d aa > aa0, bb bb0
    move ./aa ./aa0
    move ./bb ./bb0
* 1fd0236 aa, bb
    addfile ./aa
```

See how `0d94733 Merge branch 'a'` also contains `d26d325` and `0d94733`.
